# The interactive playground

[Chromatone](https://chromatone.center) audio-visual web-experience for [Touch Me](https://shop.playtronica.com/products/touchme) - the tactile MIDI instrument by [Playtronica](https://playtronica.com).

## How to play

- Open any [WebMIDI enabled browser](https://caniuse.com/?search=midi) on any device
- Connect a MIDI-controller via USB, Bluetooth or DIN to the device
- OR just use your desktop keyboard
- Play notes and collect stats
- Hold any note for 3 seconds to have scene change randomly.

## What to try

- **Swap scenes** with icon buttons to the left. Scenes change randomly after any note being held for over 3 seconds, or pressing Spacebar or Enter key.
- **Quantize notes** to 1/8, 1/16, 1/32 or free time with the bottom-left button.
- **Offset notes** by -2,-1,0,+1 or +2 octaves with a button above.
- **Change oscillator waveform** with a wave button. It will also help you shut any hang notes that may ocasionally appear.
- **Route MIDI** from inputs to outputs, both hardware or software
- **Monitor MIDI** in message log
- **Dark mode** - turn the lights on or off with a button to the top and left.
- **Stretch to fullscreen** with the toggle in the top-right corner
